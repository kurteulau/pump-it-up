Problem description: predict the operating condition of unlabelled waterpoints given a labelled dataset of 54,900 waterpoints. Features in the "not clean" dataset include characteristics such as the location, installer, construction year, and type of well. This project is an entry in the Pump It Up competition held by Driven Data.

The directory structure for my work follows the general organizational guidance also provided by Driven Data, which can be found [here](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). The rules of the competition prohibit the publication of the data by third parties, though you can find the dataset at Driven Data using the link found in the data/external folder.
